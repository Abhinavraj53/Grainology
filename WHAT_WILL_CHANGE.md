# What Will Change in Registration Flow

## OLD Flow (Current):
1. Basic Info (Mobile, Language)
2. Address
3. Account Details + Role Selection
4. Verification (Didit.me)

## NEW Flow (Will Implement):
1. **Role Selection** (FIRST - user chooses role first)
2. **Verification Method** (PAN/Aadhaar for individuals, GST/CIN for companies)
3. **Document Verification** (Cashfree API)
4. **Auto-filled Details** (Read-only from verified document)
5. **Review & Create Account** (Final step with all details)

## Key Changes:
- Role selection moves to Step 1
- New verification method selection step
- Cashfree replaces Didit.me
- Auto-fill from verified documents
- Review step before account creation
